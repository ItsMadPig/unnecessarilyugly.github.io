<h3>
	CINDY HSU IS A SCULPTOR + FEELINGS-BASED ARTIST FROM TAIWAN. SHE LIKES TO PLAY. A LOT. WHICH OFTEN RESULTS IN OBJECTS WANTING TO BE HELD AND DIORAMAS WANTING TO BE PLAYED WITH. HER PAST WORK ADDRESSES HER EXPERIENCES IN TRAUMA AND HEALING, STRENGTH IN PASSIVITY, DIASPORIC MOVEMENT, AND SOMETIMES, NOTHING AT ALL. 
	<br>
	SHE USUALLY JUST WANTS TO MAKE YOU LAUGH.
